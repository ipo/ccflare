/**
 * How one ccflare provider's model ids map onto the models.dev catalogue.
 *
 * Pricing itself is never stored here. ccflare has a single price source --
 * the models.dev catalogue fetched by `@ccflare/core`'s pricing module -- and
 * this file only says *where in that catalogue to look*. Rates therefore stay
 * current without anyone editing this repo.
 *
 * Two facts need expressing:
 *
 * 1. `catalogues` -- which catalogue provider blocks to consult first. The
 *    catalogue is keyed by provider, and the same model id appears under many
 *    resellers at different rates, so an unordered scan would price a request
 *    at whichever block happened to come first in the JSON. Naming the
 *    first-party block makes the lookup deterministic.
 * 2. `modelAliases` -- the catalogue id for a model whose ccflare-visible id
 *    differs. Subscription plans are the reason this exists: they publish
 *    plan-specific ids that the catalogue lists at zero cost because the plan
 *    is flat-rate. Aliasing them onto the metered id records what the traffic
 *    would have cost at list price, which is what makes providers comparable
 *    in the dashboard.

 * `k3` behind a smaller context limit and Moonshot does not price it
 * separately, so both alias to `kimi-k3`.
